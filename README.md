- open terminal from the directory in which .py files are located
- run the file using command "python <file_name>.py"


Necessary Packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- pandas
- from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
- from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
- from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

Note: If the code is executed is Visual Studio code, then jupiter is necessary to
view the plot
